Description:

The goal of this project was to create a functional password generator with some started code1. My approach was to create several arrays containing all of the possible characters that could comprise the password. Once the arrays were established I had to set up a series of window prompts that essentially return a true or false. Each input that is selected and returns true adds more characters to a seperate concatenated array that will be the character pool for the password. At the conclusion of the prompts a function taking advantage of a for loop and the built-in Math object puts a password together based on the chosen length. Lastly, and also instantaneously, the generated password takes advantage of the text area id in the HTML to write over the placeholder value with the random password that was generated.
